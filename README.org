** Usage

Use =M-x elcontext= for on overview of all contexts. Within this
overview several hydras will guide through the API, press =?= to open

- timespan,
- directory,
- and action.

If any part of a context is omitted it part is always valid e.g. no location
means anywhere, no time means anytime. Each command is triggered once per day.
** Use Cases
**** Work / Home development environment 
Start all work applications when you're in the office, stop them when you're
home (and start others). This was the initial reason to create =elcontext=. It
integrates well with [[https://github.com/rejeep/prodigy.el][prodigy]]. You can define all applications you need at work
or home as prodigy-services.
**** Add yours!
If your using =elcontext= I am happy to hear about your use cases!
